# 📓 Muslim Learning Journal

A simple, offline CLI app to help Muslims **track, reflect, and grow** in their learning journey — especially Qur'an studies and other Islamic or personal development subjects.

---

## 🌟 About the Project

**Muslim Learning Journal** is a terminal-based personal progress tracker built with Python.  
It allows you to log daily learning efforts like:

- 🕋 **Qur'an Tafseer study**  
- 🎙️ **Qur'an Tilawat (Recitation/Manzil)**  
- 📚 **Other subjects** (Islamic studies, Arabic, general knowledge, school material, etc.)

It is ideal for:
- Muslim students who want a daily study journal  
- Parents who want to track their child's learning  
- Teachers giving regular assignments  
- Self-learners who want to build discipline  

---

## ✨ Why Is It Beneficial?

Islam encourages **self-accountability** (`Muhasabah`) and consistency (`Istiqamah`) in all efforts.

This journal helps you:

- 🧠 Stay organized and aware of your learning progress  
- 📆 Build a habit of **daily Qur'an engagement**, even if small  
- 📊 Reflect on weekly activity and spot gaps  
- 🛠️ Store learning logs permanently as `.json` and beautifully formatted `.md` files  

**You stay consistent. The journal keeps track.**  
No internet, no signup, just you and your learning.
